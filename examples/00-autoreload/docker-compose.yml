# NOTE: The autoloading feature works with image phpswoole/swoole:latest (or phpswoole/swoole in short)
# only. For any other image, you need to use it as a base image and install package inotify-tools first
# to make it work, like
#
#    FROM phpswoole/swoole:4.4.4-php7.3
#
#    RUN \
#        apt-get update                   && \
#        apt-get install -y inotify-tools && \
#        rm -r /var/lib/apt/lists/*
#
version: '3'
